# Beta-Sigma VAE (BS-VAE)

To reproduce the results of the ICPR 2024 paper.  


This is the exact code used in the paper, and it is very personalized currently.  
The architecture `model.py` is ready to use and made easy to understand, but the training code `main.py` would be difficult to operate, so please use it as a reference.  


If you find it difficult to use, please open an issue. I will fix it when I have time.
